/*
Single Perception Artificial Neural Network


For an input vector X = {x_1,x_2,...,x_j}
and weights W = {w_0,w_1,...,w_j} where w_0 is the bias,
there is an activation function, f(z) where z = W.X. { w_0 + x_1*w_1 + ... + x_j*w_j }.
The output of the perception is the output of f.

f is a binary classifier, i.e, f can only output 1 of 2 values.
